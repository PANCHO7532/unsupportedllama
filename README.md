# llama.cpp for legacy devices
Set of patches and workflows to build llama.cpp for uncommon devices/platforms, check [actions](https://github.com/PANCHO7532/personal-llamacpp-builds/actions) for updated artifact builds, you'll need a GitHub account in order to download these until I wire up the release workflows

## When is a new build released?
Unfortunately GitHub actions isn't entirely free so i'll be running the workflow whenever I remember this repository exists, or at least one time per week, if you're really desperate for a more up-to-date build, open an issue and ask me to run the workflow

## Builds currently being made
- Windows XP x86/x64, CPU only

## Planned builds
- Android (armv7/arm64) targeting version 4 or 5
- Ubuntu 12.04 build

#### More info to be added soon:tm:
